# BRUSH INSTRUCTIONS

This game is called brush and can be played with, 2, 3 or 4 players.
It uses standard playing cards. Every card is worth a determined amount of points:
Aces are worth 1.
(from 2 to 7): the card is worth it's number.
Qs are worth 8
Js are worth 9
Ks are worth 10
When a game starts, 4 cards are moved from the room's card pile to the table. A random player is selected to begin playing.
When cards are at the table, all players can see them.
Besides the table cards, each player only sees their own cards.
The player who's turn is, has to play one of their cards.
If the player can combine one of their cards with any cards from the table in a way that their total value is 15, all of the played cards go to the player's collected cards pile.
Eg.: table has ACE, 4, 2, 6. player has 5, 2, ACE. player (playing optimally) will chose to play their card 5 and use the table's 4 and 6. together, they make 15.
If the player can't combine one of their cards with any cards from the table in a way that their total value is 15, the player will simply add they card to the table.
Eg.: table has ACE, 4, 2, 6. player has 2, 2, ACE. player has no way to sum cards making it 15, so they just leave their card on the table.

After the player played their card, it will be the next person's turn. Turns go following the players' indexes. Eg.: a game with 3 players (p0,p1,p2). p1 was randomly selected to be the first to play. after p1's turn, it's p2's turn. after p2's turn, it's p0's turn. after p0's turn, it's p1 turn again, and so on.

every time a player has no cards in hand, the draw 3 cards from the room.
the game goes on until there are no more cards in the room available to draw and no more players have cards in their hands.

when that happens the round is over and points are counted.

whoever has collected the most cards gets a point, if there's a tie, no one gets a point
whoever has collected the most diamond suit cards gets a point, if there's a tie, no one gets a point
whoever has collected the 7 of diamonds gets a point, this will not necessarily happen every round
whoever has the highest sum of collected cards from different suits and that have a number on them gets a point, if there's a tie, no one gets a point. this means that this sum is consisted of up to four cards, each of them must have different suits and the maximum sum value is 28 since the highest card that counts for this sum is a 7, because Q, J and K aren't numbers (even though they have a value when played, they are not valid for this sum)

the game doesn't have a round limit, it will go on until someone makes at least 15 points summing all rounds

since it's an online game the flow is summarized like this:
someone creates a room and invites their friends to play
up to 3 friends join the room
the room creator decides when the game starts
they play each round and view a summary of the points after each round
they play the next round until someone makes 15 points
