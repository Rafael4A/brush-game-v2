# Brush Card Game Tutorial

**Welcome to Brush, the exciting card game that can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players using standard playing cards!**

## Game Objective

The goal of Brush is to accumulate points by strategically playing your cards and collecting specific combinations.

## Game Setup

1. **Players:** Brush can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players.
2. **Card Values:** Each card has a specific point value:
   - Aces (A) are worth 1 point.
   - Numbered cards (2 to 7) are worth their face value.
   - Queens (Q) are worth 8 points.
   - Jacks (J) are worth 9 points.
   - Kings (K) are worth 10 points.
3. **Initial Setup:**
   - At the beginning of the game, four cards are drawn from the room's card pile and placed face-up on the table.
   - A random player is selected to start the game.

## Game Rules

1. **Table Cards:** All players can see the cards on the table. Besides these table cards, each player can only see their own hand of cards.

2. **Taking Turns:** Players take turns following their player indexes. For example, in a game with players P0, P1, and P2, if P1 starts, the turn order will be P1, P2, P0, P1, and so on.

3. **Playing a Card:** On a player's turn, they must play one of their cards. There are two options:

   - If the player can combine one of their cards with any cards from the table in a way that the total value equals 15, all played cards go to the player's collected cards pile.
     - Example: If the table has an ACE, 4, 2, and 6, and the player has a 5 and an ACE, they can choose to play the 5 and use the table's 4 and 6 to make a total of 15 points.
   - If the player cannot make a total of 15 points by combining their card with table cards, they simply add their card to the table.
     - Example: If the table has an ACE, 4, 2, and 6, and the player has two 2s and an ACE, and they cannot make 15, they add one of their 2s to the table.

4. **Drawing Cards:** Whenever a player has no cards in their hand, they draw three cards from the room's card pile.

5. **End of Round:** The game continues until there are no more cards in the room to draw, and no player has cards in their hand. At this point, the round is over.

## Scoring

After each round, points are calculated based on the following criteria:

1. **Most Collected Cards:** The player who has collected the most cards during the round receives 1 point. In case of a tie, no one gets a point.

2. **Most Diamond Suit Cards:** The player who has collected the most diamond suit cards during the round receives 1 point. In case of a tie, no one gets a point.

3. **7 of Diamonds:** If a player has collected the 7 of diamonds during the round, they receive 1 point.

4. **Highest Sum of Different Suits and Numbers:** The player with the highest sum of collected cards from different suits and with numbers (2 to 7) on them receives 1 point. Each card in this sum must have a different suit, and the maximum possible sum is 28 (since Q, J, and K are not considered numbers).

## Winning the Game

The game continues with multiple rounds until one player accumulates at least 15 points in total from all rounds.
